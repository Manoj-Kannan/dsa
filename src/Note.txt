Introduction:
Abstract Data Type  - interface         =   What are the expected behaviour from the user point of view
                                        -   (e.g. queue needs enque & deque mechanisms)
Data Structures     - implementation    -   How the behaviours are exhibited
                                        -   (e.g. queue can be implemented ny use of list)

Note:
Arrays      -   index based
            -   predefined size (allocates sections within the memory)
            -   ideal for item retrieval (if index is known)
LinkedList  -   reference based
            -   dynamic size
            -   ideal for insertion & deletion
